# Open Source Project Skeleton

I've often considered open sourcing projects that I've worked on, but had no idea how to get started. I was inspired by reading a preprint copy of the book "Forge Your Future with Open Source" by VM (Vicky) Brasseur. Most of the files included here are recommended by Brasseur for any Open Source project, however, to the best of my knowledge, I haven't included any copyrighted content.

## Who, What, Why

### Who

These files can be used by anyone who either:

1.  Has an idea for an open source project and would like to bootstrap it by starting with some essential files, or
2.  Has an existing project and would like to transition it to open source.

### What

This is not a comprehensive or a finished product, and isn't meant to be. I've included outlines, links or suggestions where I think they'll be helpful.

### Why

- Because why aren't open source web apps a thing?
- Because "Somebody Make This" exists, but not "This is Where We Make That"
- Because Bootcamp solo and group projects don't need to disappear
- Because it's hard enough to get involved with open source
- Because Ideas should have a place to go to _not_ die

## How to use these files

1.  Import these files into your project folder. (NOTE: If you're importing into an existing repo, don't replace your README with this one. If you accidentally do, and your repo is on Github, find the text of your old version in your past commits, and copy and paste it back into your repo. I think there's another way to do this with Git, you could Google "undo git commit", but that would probably turn into a nightmare.)
2.  Replace everything in this README with your own content (see below).
3.  Replace the content of the other files with your own. Use the included tips, links, suggestions, ideas or outlines where available.

## Replace this README with your own content
